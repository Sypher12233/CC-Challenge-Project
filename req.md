# Project Requirements #

Your project should document at least one HTML or CSS topic. In our example project, we documented the tags and attributes used in HTML tables layouts, but you can choose any HTML or CSS topic that you’ve learned so far—the sky is the limit!

## Possible topics could be ##

* HTML Tables
* Other HTML tags
* CSS selectors and specificity
* Common CSS properties
* If you choose to document HTML tags, open the hint to see how to include HTML tags as text in your code.

1. Your site uses HTML tables to display the documentation. Be sure to label the columns in your HTML.

In our example site, we used tables with columns for:

The tag or attribute name
The actual formatted tag `(eg. <table>)`
A description of what to use the tag for.
You can use these same columns or choose your own.

1. Your site should utilize a custom color scheme. You can use any of the named CSS colors.
1. Your site should use custom styles for any code such as HTML tags (like `<h1>`) or CSS properties or values (like font-family). Represent code using a monospace font family and a different background color.

Solution

1. Great work! Visit our forums to compare your project to our sample solution code. You can also learn how to host your own solution on GitHub so you can share it with other learners!

Your solution might look different from ours, and that’s okay! There are multiple ways to solve these projects, and you’ll learn more by seeing others’ code.

If you’d like to extend your cheat sheet, keep adding new topics to it as you continue to learn more HTML, CSS, and more. As you become more advanced with CSS, you’ll also be able to improve the styling and layout of the cheat sheet itself.
